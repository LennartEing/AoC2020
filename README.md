<h3> Hey there, </h3>
these are my solutions of Advent of Code in 2020. All of it was solved trying to find solutions that optimize problem complexity (not however space complexity). You can find Advent of Code here: https://adventofcode.com/


For some of these I needed outside help, especially with understanding the chinese remainder theorem on day 13. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem)
